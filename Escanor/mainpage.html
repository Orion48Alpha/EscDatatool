<p>Less clutter, more cleaning. No sign ups, no news letters, just you and your data.</p>

<p>Born out of frustration with the current software solutions, Escanor has been built on the concept of the 20/80 rule.
80% of the data cleaning process comes from about 20% of functions made available by a product.
Most solutions offer hard to use interfaces, requiring hours of tutorials and basic functionality hidden behind irrelivant options.
Escanor brings data alterations in languages and an interface that anyone can use, so you can feel more empowered and get more done in less time. </p>
